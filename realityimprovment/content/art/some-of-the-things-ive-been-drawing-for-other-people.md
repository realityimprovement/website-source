This was something I quickly knocked up today.

It was inspired by an episode of an awesome podcast, Historians of Time,
done by some friends of mine in a comedy group called the Invention of
Dragons. Check them out at [http://www.facebook.com/InventionOfDragons

Also the other day I drew this for another awesome group of funny
friends, the Project 52. They do comedy at one of the Hermann's bar at
Sydney Uni every Wednesday.

They wanted a cover photo for their facebook page that was a little more
specific to themeselves, so I made this as an option for them. Their
four regular shows are:

Make way for ducklings; a sketch show.  
The Improv Den; which features a performance by the Bear Pack in the
second half.  
Story Club; which is stories written by people and performed by them,
by reading from a book from chair.  
Comedy Tonic; a stand up night.

So I tried to incorporate that into a picture and they had a previous
poster witha robot fighting a dinosaur that I drew inspiration from. I
don't know if they'll use it, but it was fun to make. Check them out at
