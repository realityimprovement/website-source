I really did try to put up a comic today. But I'm just way too tired to
get something coherent out of the brain in my head. So here is a poem.

This is your brain on sleep  
notice the thoughts that are deep  
and many other benefits you reap

This is your brain sleep deprived  
I can't imagine how you survived  
But you had all that time to do the stuff, which is something I guess.
