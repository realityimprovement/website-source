removed two of the videos in the media section. Not that anyone would
notice anyway. But I recently heard some good advice for aspiring
comedians on a podcast I subscribe to that advise to hold off uploading
gigs before you were ready. So I removed the two recordings I had up and
will keep them for my own use for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have added something to the site though. &lt;a href="http://www.realityimprovement.com/videos/sketchfest-2012/" title="Sketchfest 2012"&gt;Click here to have a look at

by my super talented friends Chris and Catfish. Audio isn't great (which
is exactly what you want when filming some music) but their greatness
still comes across.&lt;/p&gt;
