I had just left Charlotte bound for
the West Coast. I ultimately didn't make it to San Fransisco. I will make a blog
post soon about all that happend for the rest of the trip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now I've finished up my adventures in America. I've been in the UK for
two months. There were no blog posts for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out to be very difficult to update while driving alone cross-country.
At the end of each day, I was very tired. Also I spent quite a few nights driving
till late and then I would park in a rest stop for the night. No chance to get
the laptop out on those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wordpress install broke. An autoupdate broke the plugin and
theme I was using to power the comic part of this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number 2 could have been a rather quick fix, but I'd already been getting a bit
fed up with wordpress anyway. So I started looking at alternatives. I'm 
familiar with the python programming language so I was looking for python alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with Django and looking at the various cms' built on that. Mezzanine
seemed large and bloated but the best choice, especially as it had the best
Python 3 support. But before I'd gotten very far into that, I chanced across
a new movement that is sweeping the blogs of technically minded bloggers. Static
site generators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static site generators take your content, articles, pages etc. and convert it
straight into html. No php, no database to worry about, 
nothing dynamic that is generated server side. 
This leads to fast, secure websites that can be hosted almost anywhere. 
I've even moved this website to github, which allows hosting of static websites. 
This is free and faster than my old hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many static site generators out there, written in almost any language
you can think of. Github even has one built in written in ruby. But as I'm 
familiar with python I looked into python versions. Settling on pelican, as it
has the largest community behind it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a great, if slow learning experience. Through porting my website over
I've been relearning how to code, something I haven't done in a while. I'm now
officially an open source contributor, having coded up three plugins and altering
a fourth to get all the functionality I had with wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the website is back. Expect more travel posts. But more importantly, expect
more comics as well. The site will still be going through some cosmetic changes
over the next few weeks. I've been brushing up on my css skills and learning all
the new html5 stuff. This may lead to a junior web design job, or some freelance
work. Something I can do on the road if I need to so I can start travelling again.
It would be great to land some acting work but if I don't this would be something
versatile and creative, and let me live a digital nomad lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Wordpress"></category><category term="Pelican"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="USA"></category><category term="UK"></category><category term="London"></category></entry><entry><title>Hey, look at that</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2012/May/hey-look-at-that/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-23T01:54:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-05-23:2012/May/hey-look-at-that/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;that there, in the url bar/tab. A new favicon. That's what I did to the
website today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the Jetpack plugin is bad, and blocks things. Any problems you have
with the media pages should be gone now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the media page; I somehow performed the popcorn song at an
open mic night tonight. That was a little odd. Was much better received
than it had any right to be.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Music"></category><category term="Wordpress"></category></entry><entry><title>Media Page</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2011/December/media-page/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-09T12:45:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2011-12-09:2011/December/media-page/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href="media"&gt;media link&lt;/a&gt; in the side bar.

&lt;p&gt;Spent the last couple of days just playing with the layout and CSS.
There's still a few niggly things that annoy me but I've definitely
reached the point where I can walk away from it and be happy. It's
simple and clean and that's good enough for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now; make the things happen time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Wordpress"></category></entry><entry><title>Welcome</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2011/September/ignore-this-for-now/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-09-13T15:18:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2011-09-13:2011/September/ignore-this-for-now/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've landed on this page which means you're probably someone I know.
Hey you, sorry we haven't talked in so long, we should definitely catch
up soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enjoy the ride, ridicule me harshly. Updates will be sporadic
but I'll try to keep them semi-frequent. But hopefully by me putting
this up and welcoming you all it becomes something I do, rather than
something I don't.&lt;/p&gt;
