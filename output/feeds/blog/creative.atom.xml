&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Drawing of Hot Air Balloon through sniper's scope" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Deadliest-Game.jpg" title="Deadliest Game" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was inspired by an episode of an awesome podcast, Historians of Time,
done by some friends of mine in a comedy group called the Invention of
Dragons. Check them out at &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/InventionOfDragons%20" title="IODragons "&gt;http://www.facebook.com/InventionOfDragons&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also the other day I drew this for another awesome group of funny
friends, the Project 52. They do comedy at one of the Hermann's bar at
Sydney Uni every Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cartoon of Giant Duck fighting a Giant Bear" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Cover-Photo.jpg" title="Cover Photo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wanted a cover photo for their facebook page that was a little more
specific to themeselves, so I made this as an option for them. Their
four regular shows are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make way for ducklings; a sketch show.&lt;br /&gt;
The Improv Den; which features a performance by the Bear Pack in the
second half.&lt;br /&gt;
Story Club; which is stories written by people and performed by them,
by reading from a book from chair.&lt;br /&gt;
Comedy Tonic; a stand up night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tried to incorporate that into a picture and they had a previous
poster witha robot fighting a dinosaur that I drew inspiration from. I
don't know if they'll use it, but it was fun to make. Check them out at

Jokes are
difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I found something. It's a feeling guys. That transcendent moment
when the thought I just had distills into setup and punchline. The
feeling of future laughs, echoing through time. I had one joke tonight
that got that feeling when I wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's another feeling. The "I find this joke funny feeling but it will
probably only get a mild chuckles" feeling. That's fine, that's a fun
place as well. Because I can sell it. Or save it. I had a joke like that
tonight, which I save with a second punchline. It gave me smiles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then theres the ideas that have something amusing about them. But they
are not jokes. They don't have feelings attached to them. What does
Billy the Cat have to say about those ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Gif of Cat Shaking Head" src="http://realityimprovement.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/CatNo.gif" title="Billy says no" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope, not today. (Billy lives at my brother's house. He is very wise
regarding the art of making laughs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally references. They get the laugh I expect. Good old dependable
references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I'll post my headshots I made today. Because it's serious
business time in regards to getting the acting jobs. Also; narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Cat"></category><category term="Comedy"></category><category term="Gifs"></category><category term="Standup"></category><category term="Writing"></category></entry><entry><title>Tone Deaf: The Musical</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2012/May/tone-deaf-the-musical/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-12T04:38:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-05-12:2012/May/tone-deaf-the-musical/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;That's the title I've just given the musical I haven't written yet.
