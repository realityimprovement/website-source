out again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm back. And I bring skills, I learnt to make Gifs. Look at this
one of my housemate doing a dance.&lt;/p&gt;

get something coherent out of the brain in my head. So here is a poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your brain on sleep&lt;br /&gt;
notice the thoughts that are deep&lt;br /&gt;
and many other benefits you reap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your brain sleep deprived&lt;br /&gt;
I can't imagine how you survived&lt;br /&gt;
But you had all that time to do the stuff, which is something I guess.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Blogging"></category><category term="Excuses"></category><category term="Fun"></category><category term="Poetry"></category><category term="Rhymes"></category></entry><entry><title>Posting Because I said I would</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2012/May/posting-because-i-said-i-would/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-10T01:19:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-05-10:2012/May/posting-because-i-said-i-would/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to make a comic tonight, but despite having a few
working ideas swirling around in my head, I can't seem to get any down
on "paper". So blog post it is. But I don't really have anything to say.
I just went and saw Ross Noble for the second time, and he was great.
It's amazing to just start relating to a whole audience so quickly and
friendly like. I'm also inspired by his show format, the half written
half improvised stuff would be so fun to do I feel. Anyway, really good
night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing from china finally shipped. Yay, useless now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday Yas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've slept in too much the last couple of days, tomorrow I want to get
up and be useful, before I go to do some impro. Impro should be fun so
yay for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm in a weird mood.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Birthday"></category><category term="Comedy"></category><category term="Ebay"></category><category term="Photography Equipment"></category><category term="Ross Noble"></category><category term="Shipping"></category><category term="Sleep Deprivation"></category><category term="Stand Up"></category></entry><entry><title>Shipping from China takes too long</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2012/May/shipping-from-china-takes-too-long/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-06T01:38:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-05-06:2012/May/shipping-from-china-takes-too-long/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I bought my housemates old Canon 5D Mark ii when he upgraded to the Mark
iii. I bought it to make video with so did all the research and it
basically said you can save money buying non-canon lenses second hand
and buying adaptors to fit them to my camera. Stage one went fantastic,
I bought a great looking Olympus 50mm prime lens from ebay and it
shipped in a day. Stage 2 order an adaptor ring also from ebay. This
stage failed so spectacularly. I've owned the camera for a month, and I
really wanted to start by using my own lenses so I could get a feel for
them. Today I used it for the first time (it's gorgeous btw, very happy
with it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ebay ring still hasn't shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up going into a brick and mortar camera store and buying a very
expensive adaptor ring so I could finally start playing with my camera,
negating most of the advantage of buying off brand. Never the less, it
looks great and I have some very video friendly friends. I'll import the
videos and try to edit something together later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if I could only think of a project to film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I forgot how draining working a full week could be. Back
at Masterchef for the week, and working in that studio is very draining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other other news, I have my 3rd (actually 4th) ever stand up gig on
Monday, which I'm really looking forward too. I'll try and record it
with my new camera and sound recorder. I've been thinking a lot about
comedy lately. I don't think this will help me be funny, but it's a
point of conversation that could be raise and discussed if this wasn't
such a one way mode of conversation. With you, my non-existent
readership.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Ebay"></category><category term="Equipment"></category><category term="Impatience"></category><category term="Masterchef"></category><category term="Photography"></category><category term="Shipping"></category><category term="Standup"></category><category term="Update"></category><category term="Work"></category></entry></feed>
