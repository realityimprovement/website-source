Needless
to say that a lot of stuff happened. I wanted to write a long post about
everything. But it's the kind of thing that I wouldn't want to post
unless it was perfect, and that would just lead to putting it off
forever. Basically a year ago I was having a lot of problems and I
needed to make some changes. I didn't work for about 4 months and things
weren't great. Here is an abridged version of some of the things that
changed following this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Drawing of bridge with the word stuff under it" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bridge.png" title="bridge" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave up drinking. It's not the first time I've said that, but it's the
first time I haven't added the addendum of "for now".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered barefoot jogging. I went on a trip with some friends where
I started joggin along the beach and was really enjoying it. When I got
home I didn't really enjoy it as much. A google search put me on to the
barefoot running movement and I was inspired to try it. And jogging
became fun again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Drawing of man running barefoot" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Barefoot-Run.png" title="Barefoot Run" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More days lost to the internet after this showed me tiny houses and
minimalist living. Again I was inspired and I started downsizing my
life. When my housemates and I moved, I got a much smaller room and
filled it with less stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to start working again. For the last few years I've done art
department for TV shows. The 4 months off involved no TV work and I was
just picking up odd jobs, working for my dad and elsewhere. I was burnt
out. Returning to art department work showed me I really had lost
interest in the work: long hours without a schedule that I could plan
around. It is a job that consumes all your time, and I wasn't willing to
do that anymore for shows that I didn't enjoy or think were worth it. So
after finishing one show I started looking for something else to do, and
only sticking to casual gigs in the TV world so that I wouldn't get
stuck on something and lose all my time again. I contemplated other
jobs; there was a day that I considered becoming a baker at baker's
delight, I tried riding a pedicab around Sydney for a few weeks. I
contemplated other options, like returning to uni and finishing my
degree or applying for acting schools. But nothing seemed like the right
thing to do. I did do some enjoyable stuff during this time like some
improv teaching at a drama school and few days as an extra on a show I'd
previously done art department for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the minimalist blogs out there that I've read state that one of
the best things about having little stuff and few expenses are all the
money left over to dedicate to travel. I've had the urge to travel since
I was 16 when I spent two weeks in Japan. But due to my being generally
a lazy person, my overseas travel since then has consisted of week in
Thailand for a cousin's wedding and a week in the UK tagging along on my
father's business trip when he flew me over using his frequent flyer
points as a gift for my birthday. Well it was time to stop saying I
wanted to go travelling and start travelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 2m by 2.2m room became a single carry on sized bag and a mandolin I
don't know how to play that I got from a friend. I sold my van and I
filed my tax return. I decided I was going. I didn't know where, but it
was time go. I decided on a plan that had been boiling in the back of my
brain for a while, the 2 year working holiday visa for young Australians
to live and work in the UK. Other than that I had no plan. All I wanted
was to leave soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days struggle I ended up taking one last job for 8 weeks. It
was difficult because I now knew what I wanted, but the extra money
allowed me to buy a new computer, a surface pro, to replace my heavy
macbook and tablet for travel and have a bit more or a safety margin for
the initial holiday part of my trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Crude drawing of a surface pro computer" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/surface.png" title="surface" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm ~~writing this now on the aeroplane en route to the final week of
filming~~ finished writing this up after filming (this job really does
eat up all your time). Posting from Kuala Lumpur airport waiting for my
connecting flight to France where I'll spend three weeks hanging out
with friends, exploring and catching up on sleep. I've been learning
french using Duolingo. After that I have 2 months in the US, basing
myself with a friend who has an apartment in New York, but travelling
around different places so I don't become a burden on him. I'll try to
do some improv courses and catch some comedy and theater. And then in
December I land in the UK to start something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no plans or jobs lined up. I have my savings and a work visa. For
the next few years I'm a professional nomad, going where opportunity
calls and interesting things seem to be happening. I'll most likely be
alternating between short term work in the UK and travelling different
parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's why it's important to give up on the posts about the dark
stuff that I've been putting off writing, and start posting again.
Because life is now an adventure, and my friends have begged me to keep
them up to date.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Adventure"></category><category term="Alcohol"></category><category term="Art"></category><category term="Barefoot"></category><category term="Drawing"></category><category term="Drinking"></category><category term="Jogging"></category><category term="Mental Issues"></category><category term="Minimalism"></category><category term="Running"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Work"></category></entry><entry><title>The, I couldn't finish my comic, blog post</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2012/June/the-i-couldnt-finish-my-comic-blog-post/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-11T03:47:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-06-11:2012/June/the-i-couldnt-finish-my-comic-blog-post/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Turns out I lied, but not for lack of good intentions. I wanted to be
updating, I really did, but I was in bed sick all week with a bad fever.
I'm still having trouble concentrating. This leads to the double problem
of not having written anything, nor done anything to inspire writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, lots of rage and stuff, in the most non rage-y way. Lots to
think through. (I don't like this vague sentence any more but I dislike
removing it more. Needless to say my brain is hurting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was drawing a comic, but I feel it might be too ambitious and not funny
enough, and it definitely can't be finished today. I'll try again
tomorrow. I hope to finish it, but there is a &gt; 0% chance I hate it
halfway through and give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standup on wednesday. Hooray.&lt;/p&gt;

Plus
a regular 10 hour day. I just really didn't have the time to myself in
order to comic or blog. I was creative at one point of the week, but it
was something I wasn't sure I could post, but it turns out I can so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started working my friend Paul's computer game start up, See
Through Studios. It's a bit of fun, I hope to be helpful there. So the
one day I stayed up late I was creating this...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Overhead view of triangles with lights" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/lighting-scaled.jpg" title="lighting scaled" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a small concept for a possible style for the game they're working
on at the moment, set in the world of
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland"&gt;Flatland.&lt;/a&gt; It's unlikely that
this will be used, but it was a important for me to do, because I'd had
the idea stuck in my head and I also learnt to use a little bit of
Blender, a 3d modelling and animation software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other work news, besides working heavily this last week, I've got a
interview for a runner's role on a small show on Wednesday. I don't know
if I want to take it, I'm enjoying the freedom of the casual work load,
but steady income is nice. But I'm not feeling it, that is I'm not
excited about the job. Maybe I'll warm up to it, but it's a commitment
to not the things I want to be working on for 8 weeks. Stuff like the
musical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In musical news, no further contact has come through. Which means my
zero effort at finding a venue has probably resulted in not having a
venue. This is probably a good thing, I've been feeling a little uneasy
about the schedule. I'm a huge fan of pumping out content and seeing
what sticks to the wall, but everything has it's place and I feel my
first musical should be given the time it needs to mature into the show
I want it to be rather than forced onto an artificially accelerated
timeline due to a whim. This will not be going on the back burner (not
that I've been as focused as I should be on it) but unless I get the
phone call in the next two days (and maybe even then) the whole thing is
getting pushed back to November/December. Also I still kind of like the
idea of filming it rather than making it a stage show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this has been a stream of consciousness that I don't plan on
re-reading or editing. Hopefully I've been slightly coherent and it all
makes sense. Regular updates to recommence.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Blender"></category><category term="Design"></category><category term="Graphics"></category><category term="Overworked"></category><category term="Work"></category></entry><entry><title>Day of Good</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2012/May/day-of-good/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-27T00:58:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-05-27:2012/May/day-of-good/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was spent doing awesome things. I had my first ever musical jam
with a friend of mine, we're starting a band or something. Anyways, it
was fun. Reminded me of all this musical theory stuff that I have stored
in the back of my brain somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then went to the Vivid festival, which is like a festival of lights. Its
artistic installations that light up. Got some awesome photos and
hopefully some awesome video. Stand outs were the building used as a
digital canvas to tell a story, and I really enjoyed the three angler
fish mounted on tricycles that moved around Circular Quay.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Jams"></category><category term="Music"></category><category term="Sydney"></category><category term="Vivid"></category></entry><entry><title>The cryptic post, where I know what I'm talking about but I won't be specific</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2012/May/the-cryptic-post-where-i-know-what-im-talking-about-but-i-wont-be-specific/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-19T00:51:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-05-19:2012/May/the-cryptic-post-where-i-know-what-im-talking-about-but-i-wont-be-specific/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So turns out working a 16 hour day leaves you very tired. Who'd of thunk
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also worth realising, was my realisation today. It doesn't matter how
nice, earnest and easy to get along with a person is; if they are wrong,
they are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems slightly at odds with some of my knowledge about myself, that
is that I'm much more likely to give someone the benefit of the doubt if
the speak passionately and energetically. In fact some of the conflicts
I've been having are because of this stance. But while I love playing
devil's advocate for a range of things, there are a few things I
genuinely believe in, that I defend the opposing view point of. Which
makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what to do with this new information. I would still feel
uncomfortable switching the other way, to berate and belittle the things
I don't like. I don't want to say I need to be angrier more often,
because I like that I'm mostly a chilled out person. But I would like to
know how to better take advantages of the insights I'm getting that a
lot of people don't get to have.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Frustrations"></category><category term="Musings"></category><category term="Self Growth"></category><category term="Work"></category></entry><entry><title>On one particular podcast</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2012/May/on-one-particular-podcast/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-03T02:21:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-05-03:2012/May/on-one-particular-podcast/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the "This American Life" podcast today; the Ten
Commandments episode. There was a lot of stuff in there that I want to
think on, and there's already at least one comic idea stewing in my head
(not today though, 13 hour work day is long). There is a moment in one
of the stories that particularly strikes me at the moment. A virgin is
counselled by his christian minister to attend a sexaholics meeting to
help with his "impure thoughts"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its almost funny, if it wasn't so horrifically sad. And to make it
worse, at no point does the story teller even seem to consider that it's
horrible. Before he tells us how he eventually found relief when he
encountered a christian counseller kind enough to say, "hey, just jerk
it," (paraphrased) he describes how none of the (legitimate) sexaholics
understand his situation. With a tone, that smacks to me of sadness at
his believed illness rather than the quite awful situation he should
never have been put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a an athiest, I don't often seek out the witness and faith of
believers. I forget that the majority of Americans are religious, and a
show like This American Life doing a Ten Commandments episode will do it
earnestly and won't be a deconstruction of the commandments and
religion. And in accidentally stumbling across something I wouldn't seek
out I'm given a chance to question and re-affirm my beliefs. And how did
I feel after the episode? Sad. Sad that good, decent people (there were
a few stories with a similar resonance to me) are forced to engage in a
mental self torture for their faith. Sad that good people need to make
them selves miserable to make themselves feel like they are good people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't find god listening to this, but I learnt how cruel religion can
be, especially to the truest believer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="America"></category><category term="Atheism"></category><category term="Athiest"></category><category term="Mental Heath"></category><category term="Musings"></category><category term="Philosophy"></category><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="Religion"></category><category term="This American Life"></category></entry><entry><title>On writing and other things I tell myself I like</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2012/April/on-writing-and-other-things-i-tell-myself-i-like/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-04-28T02:19:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-04-28:2012/April/on-writing-and-other-things-i-tell-myself-i-like/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Calling myself a writer makes it true right? I'm a comedian because I
say so. Sometimes I stand on stage, that makes me a performer. I own an
electric piano, I'm a fucking musician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't actually do those things. I tell myself I enjoy them, that they
are important to my self identity. But I don't live in the real world. I
live in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world I can work hard. I do work hard. I have had it
reinforced many times that (despite even my sometimes incessant need to
be late) I'm good at my job and a pleasure to work with. I could clock
on everyday, do what needs to be done, work a long day, go home and
switch off and repeat everyday for a long time. And there is nothing
inherently wrong with that. Except for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying that I've never worked hard for something, that I've
never actively pursued things. But it's not my standard operating
procedure. I turn up, and try to do the absolute best that I can while
I'm there. But that turning up is necessary. I don't work on my own. I
don't further or better myself. I'm not who I want to be. I can sit and
think about the things I want to do. I'm very good at imagining myself
living. I rarely do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performer. Writer. Comedian. Artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are these things important to me? Or why do I think they are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does anyone do the things they do? I'm not just a consumer, I'm a
devourer. I obsess over television to the point of not even enjoying the
act of watching it anymore. I thrive on dissection. On long
conversations about minutia, the what if's and the what does it mean for
us? And then I try to work out how it could've been done better. But
this is all a passive act, not an active one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like to admit this often, but I have a huge ego. But it's the
procrastinators ego. I never do anything, because if I don't try I can't
be proven wrong. In my head I can be perfect. In the real world I'm
lazy. I'm passionless. I'm wasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you meet someone for the first time you ask what they do, not what
they think they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't deserve my ego. But I can't live at the other end of the
spectrum either. When I'm there, it's worse than being lazy. I can't
give up on myself. I'm worth it. I have done things I'm genuinely proud
of. Things that I look back on that I struggle to give myself credit for
because it can't be because of me; I'm a lazy, useless individual. But I
did do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are the labels important for me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it's who I want to be. It's the next step. It's not stopping
before I even get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how do I achieve them. How can I answer the "what do you do"
question the way I want to? By knowing and accepting myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008 I co-directed and was in charge of the writing of the 2008
science revue. Something I had no experience in. That's one of those
things I remember a different me doing, because something worked. It
worked very well and some very good stuff came from it. And what can I
learn from the more successful and happy me. Churn out content, and have
deadlines. Most of it won't be good and will later have to be thrown
away. But you can't edit a blank page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is building up a really long way of saying that this, my own
personal spot on the internet will no longer be a blank page. I plan on
posting something everyday. It won't always be big, it won't always be
good, but it will be something. Because the only way I can learn to be
who I want to be is to be who I want to be, and not someone just
thinking about it. And I know that everyday is an impossible schedule,
and I will miss days. But I'm not giving myself the out of "a few days a
week". I know myself. I'm all or nothing and I'm sick of being nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Directing"></category><category term="Ego"></category><category term="Frustration"></category><category term="Performing"></category><category term="Ranting"></category><category term="Science Revue"></category><category term="Self Doubt"></category><category term="Success"></category><category term="Writing"></category></entry><entry><title>That Moment of Clarity</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2011/December/that-moment-of-clarity/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-07T13:18:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2011-12-07:2011/December/that-moment-of-clarity/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other night, after the Cranston Cup grand final (which was excellent
by the way, congrats to all the players) I was talking to a friend of
mine about my job, which is Art Department runner on a TV show. And she
asked if it was the set-up for my future career. I immediately said no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I've been asked in the past I always add these caveats and
conditions to that answer (which I did add later), like how it's in the
right industry, I actually do enjoy the work and if I ended up being art
department for the next 20 years I feel I would have a great career.
However this time, in the heat of conversation, it was a snap no, this
is not what I want to be doing for my life. Part of that is probably a
little bit of frustration at this particular jobs annoyances, but mostly
it's because I'm finally willing to admit my passions to myself. I want
to be a performer/writer/director whatever. I want to be a creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a struggle to juggle ego with self doubt, but it's time to realise
what my strengths and weaknesses are. And it's time to start embracing
those strengths rather than wallowing in the weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Cranston Cup"></category><category term="Frustrations"></category><category term="Passions"></category><category term="Personal Growth"></category><category term="Work"></category></entry></feed>
