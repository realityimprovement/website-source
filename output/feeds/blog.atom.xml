I had just left Charlotte bound for
the West Coast. I ultimately didn't make it to San Fransisco. I will make a blog
post soon about all that happend for the rest of the trip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now I've finished up my adventures in America. I've been in the UK for
two months. There were no blog posts for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out to be very difficult to update while driving alone cross-country.
At the end of each day, I was very tired. Also I spent quite a few nights driving
till late and then I would park in a rest stop for the night. No chance to get
the laptop out on those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wordpress install broke. An autoupdate broke the plugin and
theme I was using to power the comic part of this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number 2 could have been a rather quick fix, but I'd already been getting a bit
fed up with wordpress anyway. So I started looking at alternatives. I'm 
familiar with the python programming language so I was looking for python alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with Django and looking at the various cms' built on that. Mezzanine
seemed large and bloated but the best choice, especially as it had the best
Python 3 support. But before I'd gotten very far into that, I chanced across
a new movement that is sweeping the blogs of technically minded bloggers. Static
site generators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static site generators take your content, articles, pages etc. and convert it
straight into html. No php, no database to worry about, 
nothing dynamic that is generated server side. 
This leads to fast, secure websites that can be hosted almost anywhere. 
I've even moved this website to github, which allows hosting of static websites. 
This is free and faster than my old hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many static site generators out there, written in almost any language
you can think of. Github even has one built in written in ruby. But as I'm 
familiar with python I looked into python versions. Settling on pelican, as it
has the largest community behind it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a great, if slow learning experience. Through porting my website over
I've been relearning how to code, something I haven't done in a while. I'm now
officially an open source contributor, having coded up three plugins and altering
a fourth to get all the functionality I had with wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the website is back. Expect more travel posts. But more importantly, expect
more comics as well. The site will still be going through some cosmetic changes
over the next few weeks. I've been brushing up on my css skills and learning all
the new html5 stuff. This may lead to a junior web design job, or some freelance
work. Something I can do on the road if I need to so I can start travelling again.
It would be great to land some acting work but if I don't this would be something
versatile and creative, and let me live a digital nomad lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Wordpress"></category><category term="Pelican"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="USA"></category><category term="UK"></category><category term="London"></category></entry><entry><title>Adventures in the night.

It turns out, travelling south
for warmth only works if you don't get caught in a cold snap. It was too
cold to go walking outside so I kept driving south, stopping for dinner
on the road. But here's a photo anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10848168265/" title="It's a small town!"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010295" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2816/10848168265_b17347699b_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled into a rest stop about 9:30 to get a few hours rest. I knew it
would be cold, so plan was to rest a few hours, wake up drive some more,
pull over and rest another few hours. First part went well, I slept
until 1230 or 1am. Get back into the drivers seat, turn key and ...
nothing. I'd left my headlights on, and with the cold temps the
batteries had drained. I wasn't going anywhere. The next hour consisted
of me asking every person who stopped to use the bathroom if they had
jumper leads. No one did. I kept trying out the key periodically hoping
to get lucky. And then, all of a sudden, the car turned over and
sputtered to life. And so did the heater. Magic. Waited for the car to
warm up a little. Drove a few more hours before stopping at another rest
stop, making sure the lights were off, and getting a few more hours
sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very close to Charlotte at this point. Shortly after sunrise I was
back on the road. Rounding the bend I unexpectedly came across the city.
It was a magnificent sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No photo, I was driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had breakfast a vegan cafe, great start to the day. I'd booked a super
cheap hotel online, but they weren't able to check me in early. I did a
google search of things to do in Charlotte when the phrase disc golf
jumped into my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park was called Hornets Nest. After failing to find a disc at
Walmart (my first Walmart trip as well today. It's big I guess) I
stopped by to have a look at the course before going to a sports store.
I never made it to the sports store because I was super lucky to meet my
new friend Brian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10848813463/" title="Back at hole 1 after a round."&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010297
cropped" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3787/10848813463_c89be91e36_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's a huge frisbee golf enthusiast and great guy. He lent me a disc and
we played a round of 18 together. His score of 72 was much more
impressive than my score of 103. It was great to throw a disc around
again. Although it is a bit more difficult throwing an actual disc golf
disc rather than the ultimate frisbee sized disc I'm used to. Hornets
Nest is his favourite course in the area (turns out Charlotte is kind of
the frisbee golf capital of the world, they have heaps of courses) and I
can see why. The surroundings are beautiful, and the back nine is
essentially a walk through the woods; a bit difficult to play through
but very picturesque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the cafe in the morning, I was told about the Mint Museum, which is
more of an art gallery and free on Tuesday nights. I checked in to my
hotel, had a long overdue nap, a shower and caught the last hour of the
gallery. It was small but had some wonderful pieces. And with a pizza at
a cool restaurant a few blocks away, the perfect way to end a
wonderfully unique day in Charlotte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow morning I'm back on the road, this time headed west. I've
decided to head straight for San Francisco and do Austin and New Orleans
on the return so that I can catch up with Andy before he goes on
vacation on the 22nd. Nick is also there this week, so it'll be good to
see them both, and kind of do an early birthday thing with them.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Adventure"></category><category term="America"></category><category term="Charlotte"></category><category term="Cold"></category><category term="Disc"></category><category term="Disc Golf"></category><category term="Driving"></category><category term="Frisbee"></category><category term="New Friends"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>Washington DC and the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Towpath</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2013/November/washington-dc-and-the-chesapeake-ohio-towpath/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-11-13T05:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2013-11-13:2013/November/washington-dc-and-the-chesapeake-ohio-towpath/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Monday night I got off the bus, walked into Union Station (awesome) and
then as I exit I'm greeted with this view of the Capitol Building.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10821858913/" title="That's the capitol building at the back"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010086" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3690/10821858913_39fc2a149f_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a bit closer. This fountain was in front of the building (It's
behind me in this photo)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10821857413/" title="ooh, mesmerizing"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010090" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5520/10821857413_91e17d3e7c_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was cold! I got my phone out and started looking for a hostel to
spend the night in. I found the Youth Hostel International and went
there. And I'm super glad I did. There is at least one activity
everyday, usually a walking tour. I spent Tuesday on my own at the
Natural History museum and a little bit of the Air and Space museum.
Unfortunately my tour on Tuesday night was cancelled, but I was still so
tired I didn't mind too much. Wednesday however was excellent.
Originally I'd planned just the day in DC but wanted to do the night
monuments tour so I stayed an extra day. I met some awesome people, did
two tours a morning and then the night monuments, went back to the air
and space museum and took some more photos of the capitol. One of my new
friends, Pat, travels a lot. he commutes across canada for work, week on
week off kind of deal. But the company will let him fly anywhere that
costs the equivalent of flying home, and since it is a cross canadian
flight which is expensive. So he has a routine of finding gigs in the
towns he's visiting. So Wednesday night after walking forever all day, I
went and watch a concert. It was amazing but I was soo tired by the end
of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10821563906/" title="YEAH!"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010178" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7375/10821563906_235021f90f_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'd been on the Post Office tour in the morning, I'd spoken to the
ranger about nearby hikes, see if there was anything I could do in short
time. She told me about the Chesapeake &amp;amp; Ohio towpath that goes for 180
miles and meets up for part of the Appalachian Trail, which seemed cool.
I did a quick google and decided to try a 60 mile section to a place
called Harper's Ferry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been doing a lot of research into lightweight backpacking and
hammocks and stuff so I decided to buy a hammock for the trip. I knew
the downside of a hammock is that it can get cold underneath using just
a sleeping bag and decided to get a wool blanket instead, it's a bit
heavier but I wouldn't have to worry about a sleeping pad, and if it
turns out I was wrong about my layering system for my clothes I could
wear it as a cloak during the day for extra warmth. So leaving late in
the day thursday (it took a while to go shopping and get to the trail,
plus I slept in the morning) I set off. Sorry no photos of my campsites,
first night I didn't make a campsite so was camping on the side of the
trail, which isn't really allowed. Second night I got to camp after
dark, and in the morning was so cold I had to break camp and start
walking as soon as it was light so I could get the blood flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THINGS LEARNED ON THE TRAIL:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. I don't travel as light as I think I do:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely travel lighter than most. I know I still have a little bit
of extra weight compared to ultralight travelers, but I didn't think it
would be too bad to hike with everything I was carrying. It might not
have been if I'd been using an actual hiking pack, but because I was
using my Aeronaut bag, which has backpack straps, but isn't really
designed for long term carrying. But to add a blanket, food, hammock and
water to a pack that is already not as light as it could be, and isn't
designed for hiking was a mistake. The reason ultralight hikers get away
without suspension is they are not carrying stuff like a laptop with
them, even if it is my lightweight surface pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Do more research:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made two research mistakes. I bought the Hennessy Hammock backpacker
ultralight kit. I hadn't done enough research to know that it is
designed for people under 6 foot, and I'm slightly over. I knew the
theory behind getting comfortable in a hammock but couldn't achieve it
because it was the wrong size for me. But the bigger mistake was not
looking at what the temperatures were going to be. I thought I'd made a
mistake getting a blanket rather than sleeping bag and pad because I was
so cold at night. It was only when I went online and looked at the
temperatures that the second night had got down to freezing temperature.
So I guess the system worked, since the only really bad thing was my
feet, which froze almost immediately without a second pair of thick
socks. But I was very very cold. I don't think there will be another
camping trip this autumn unless it's much, much warmer down south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. The towpath is okay to walk, but would be much better to ride:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The towpath was very pretty, but not that interesting of a hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10821825693/" title="Look Pretty!"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010259" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3743/10821825693_36d1ddcf06_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The towpath is completely flat over its lenghth. Well that's not true,
it's actually a very, very gentle rise, but it feels flat walking it.
It's also covered in gravel. If I was strolling along, it's probably a
very enjoyable experience, but feeling weighed down, and rushing to get
to the next campsite before dark, the flat terrain can wear you down. If
I was to do it again, I'd probably try cycling or unicycling instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Know my limits:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was aiming for Harper's Ferry which is 60ish miles along the track. I
thought I could make it in 2-3 days. And if I didn't have to carry my
bag and it was summer, so I had an hour or two extra daylight and wasn't
so cold at night, I probably could. I did make it to White's Ferry,
which is 35.5 miles from the start, at about 1pm on Saturday. Since I
only hike about 5 or more miles on the Thursday because I started so
late, that might've been possible, I would estimate that was
approximately a 20 mile a day pace. But I was dead after that. I
couldn't go on. I abandoned my plan for Harper's Ferry, and started
making my way into town, to Leesburg, about 5 miles away. White's ferry
is a cool old ferry across the river, which I caught. No photos, I'd put
the camera away the day before and hadn't got it out again, too tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. I'm really bad with names. (Also Americans are really religous)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had two really cool experiences with people, but I can't remember
their names, which annoys me a lot. The first was with a cyclist that
past me twice during the day. He was doing a 60 mile ride, starting at
about mile 22 on the track, down to D.C for lunch and back again. He
spoke about how he knew Jesus, asked if I knew him. I tactfully said not
personally. But he was a super nice guy, who told me he'd had a
premonition about sharing lunch with someone. That hadn't happened but
then he'd seen me twice during the day hiking and he decided I was the
guy from the premonition and he gave me 10 bucks and a musli bar. I was
super tired and worried about getting to camp before dark (I didn't it
was dark by the time I got there), so even though he got a photo of me,
I don't have a photo of him and I forgot his name. Blargh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about halfway to town when I came across someone changing a tyre.
I asked if I could get a lift when he was done, he said yes, but didn't
seem happy about it. Shortly later another guy pulled up asking if he
could help. The tyre guy was fine, and I asked if I could get a lift to
town, and he said yes. The motel was actually just around the corner
from his house. So this was my first (and possibly only in America)
hitchhike. I can not remember his name though. I do remember he was on
his way home from doing some work at his pastors house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent two days at the Days Inn Leesburg. After the first night, I woke
up, still too sore to do anything useful and booked a second day. And it
was expensive. Each night cost \$100. If I do that every night I would
spend a lot of money. And I realised if I decided to hitchhike, I'd have
no control over where I end up each day, and would have to use these
side of the road motels which could be quite expensive. I'd already
looked into hiring a car and knew it worked out to be cheaper if I was
okay sleeping in it, even with petrol costs. So this is what I've done.
I've hired a small Toyota Yaris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And between the big stops where I can stay at a hostel or couch surf,
I'll sleep in the car at the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Adventure"></category><category term="America"></category><category term="Camping"></category><category term="Driving"></category><category term="Hiking"></category><category term="New Friends"></category><category term="Photos"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="USA"></category><category term="Washington D.C."></category></entry><entry><title>Trying to travel better</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2013/November/trying-to-travel-better/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-11-06T03:02:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2013-11-06:2013/November/trying-to-travel-better/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;First of all, I haven't posted about New York. It was great, I saw some
improv, some comedy, I saw a Broadway show and I went to Sleep No More
which was fantastic and I want to go back. Although I might read Macbeth
before that though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And New York had the best day ever, which is a Halloween puppy parade.
In costume!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look it's hulk dog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10530531976/" title="HULK DOG!"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000918" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7291/10530531976_a72172a599_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these guys won best costume, lobster and chef dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10530528655/" title="They were very cute. See previous image in flikr set for a better overview of whole set up"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000906" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2873/10530528655_6b6f619591_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as good as New York was, and as wonderful as the people I met were,
there was still that same feeling that I had in Paris. That I wasn't
entirely satisfied with my trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to say that it was too easy because I don't believe that my
travels should be difficult. Rather that I haven't challenged myself to
grow or change. Before continuing I have to say that I'm super grateful
to my friends who have let me stay at their place. Staying with friends
has been wonderful (and cheap). But the longish stays with no plans (or
job) and the fact that they go out during the days means there were
quite a few days I would stay home rather than go out exploring. The
worst were the days I would sleep in, then spend the rest of the day on
the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a problem for me, because I tend towards laziness, which leads
to a downward spiral of bad days. Cindy very insightfully said to me on
a morning in Lyon when I was delaying getting off the couch and outside,
"Being in a different country isn't going to cure depression.” It is
inevitable that I'm going to have down days still. And I'll have the
occasional manic day too. But if I'm being someone I don't like on
normal days, how am I supposed to get through the bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there are some things I need to work out. Short term and long term.
In the short term I wanted to get out of bed and get moving everyday, to
have new experiences. So I stayed in New York for Halloween, but now I
have left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10692039953/" title="Insert where did I go, there I am joke here"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1010067" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5492/10692039953_5c4413d283_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No safety net. I'm on my own and via hitch-hiking and other cheap
transport I'm going to attempt to cross the country, or as much as I can
do before I leave. So far I've caught a bus to Atlantic City, where I
spent a few days. I caught another bus to Washington D.C. where I'm
sitting now in a hostel writing this post. The rough plan from here is
to head south, aiming for New Orleans. Then West across Texas and the
southern States, a stop in Las Vegas and L.A. and hopefully all the way
to San Francisco to meet up with my friend Andy. If for some reason
everything goes much quicker than planned and I don't then fly back to
New York, I'll come back via Chicago to watch some more improv.
Hopefully this plan also helps me with another problem I feel I have
which is a fair bit of social awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other things I've started to implement include timeboxing some
things, to limit my internet usage and to instigate constructive things
like blog writing. Also, I've been dabbling with meditation and being
present and focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long term I need to find what I want to do next. The plan at the
moment is to alternate work in the UK with travel in Europe. And this
may be fine, I don't know yet, I haven't tried. But I feel a better
solution is going to be a digital job that I can do on the road so that
I can live more of a digital nomad life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind I have a few things I would like to get better at: my
art and to get back into making comics; more performing, predominately
acting and improv, but also get back into stand up; writing; possibly
editing; and music. This last one is giving me a bit of a problem at the
moment. I'm still carrying around the mandolin I was given by a friend
in Sydney. But I really don't play it enough to justify carrying it
around. The mandolin itself isn't that heavy, but I've put it in a case
and it is big enough and awkward enough to get in the way. I'm otherwise
carrying around just one bag, and that bag is almost light enough that I
could carry it around all day without worry (There is a whole post to
come on bags and what I'm carrying with me). The mandolin means I always
need to find somewhere to dump my luggage for the day. So I either need
to make this a part of my daily routine or it's time to let the bulky
instrument go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final related skill I want to start learning is animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway I'm going to post this and go out and explore Washington. I
didn't really take any photos of Atlantic City, it's a weird place and I
spent a lot of it at the poker table anyway. But I did make sure I
walked the boardwalk. It was cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'll finish this post with two photos of central park. This one was
my favourite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10530462003/" title="Something something, photography, something something, capturing light"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000852" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5529/10530462003_c5059d9317_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this was great. I had walked halfway around the lake before seeing
this sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was walking the wrong way.

Through a quirk of geography and
weird bus routes, in high school it was almost exactly the same amount
of time to walk to school through the bush as to catch the afternoon bus
home. So I would often walk home that way, dressed in my school shoes
and uniform, carrying my bag full of books. I have just realised how
much I must have enjoyed this because typing that out makes it seem like
a lot of hard work. But growing up in Australia I learnt to enjoy the
outdoors but was also warned of the many things that can hurt you like
spiders and snakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been reading about so many barefooted adventures though that when
I arrived in Fontainbleau by train and started walking through the bush
I felt an urge to remove my shoes and try my first ever barefoot hike.
And it was great. I thoroughly enjoyed myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10280265956/" title="My feet ready for adventure"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000622" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5468/10280265956_ba52674788_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day started late as I slept in longer than planned. This worked out
well as Nick's connecting flight from Barcelona to Paris had been
delayed and we had lunch at a nice vegetarian restaurant near Notre
Dame. I then hopped on a train south while he caught a taxi back to the
airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had headed to Fontainbleau and the suggestion of my hosts. There is
apparently a nice chateau with awesome gardens there, but I never made
it because as soon a got off the train I headed straight into the woods.
I walked for ages, saw some cool looking trees, rocks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10280389953/" title="Scary/cool mine cave thing"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000623" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3833/10280389953_d66fc4079a_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took some photos of bugs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10530606003/" title="Hello!"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000632" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7337/10530606003_e0893dd887_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool moment about an hour before getting dark was coming across this
stone look out tower that had a 360 degree view of everything around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10530414634/" title="Imposing and practical"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000641" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7370/10530414634_c77ce7c76c_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked around a little too long, it was dark by the time I got back to
the village. But I grabbed a cheap but delicious pizza for dinner and
waited for the train back to Paris. The pizza was a little difficult to
eat because it's not customary in France to cut it into slices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've called it my favourite day in Paris because it reminded me (as well
as walking around the gardens of Versailles to a lesser extent) how
important walking the great outdoors is to me. It is definitely going to
impact my plans next year, if not also how I'm going to spend my time
after New York. Stay tuned for that as it's hopefully going to be
exciting. But also I tried something new with the barefoot hike, and it
was very successful. My feet didn't hurt at the end but they were
covered in dirt, which is fine by me. But it also brushed off quickly
and cleanly as well, which was also nice.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Adventure"></category><category term="Barefoot"></category><category term="Bush Walking"></category><category term="Fontainbleau"></category><category term="France"></category><category term="Hiking"></category><category term="Insect"></category><category term="Nature"></category><category term="Paris"></category><category term="Priorities"></category><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Quick wrap up of Paris</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2013/October/quick-wrap-up-of-paris/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-10-30T09:37:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2013-10-30:2013/October/quick-wrap-up-of-paris/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been in New York now for 2 and a half weeks so I've decided to
condense Paris into two posts. This one will be a quick wrap up and
tomorrow I'll post a day report of one of my favourite days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summing up my experience in Paris is weird. Thinking back it feels like
I didn't do all that much but if I look at the photos or think of
specific days (the ones where I didn't stay inside that is) I realise I
did do a lot. I did some of the obviously touristy things; Notre Dame,
Sacre Coeur, The Lourve, Musee D'orsay etc. There were a lot of days
just walking around and seeing what I could see. I discovered an awesome
little botanical gardens which is where those photos of the cats and
peacocks in the previous post came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed with a good friend of mine from Australia, Caitlin, who is
doing a PHD in Paris. She has two housemates Carmen and Umeshree and all
three are the best. This photo was from the first night in Paris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10003441786/" title="Caitlin, Carmen and Umeshree"&gt;&lt;img alt="_1000225" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3667/10003441786_f076b9615c_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also hung out a lot with my old housemate from Australia, Nick (this
is also who I'm staying with in New York). Before he went to Barcelona
with other friend Lisa and Sammy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10038675513/" title="He wasn't expecting to be photograhed"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000477" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/10038675513_1d35680716_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my days consisted of buying a baguette at a boulangerie and
walking till I was lost. Or riding one of the Velibes. The Velibe and
Velo-v system in Lyon were both great, I used them extensively. Arriving
in New York, I have missed how good these systems were. New York has
there Citi Bike system which is similar in principle but priced much
more expensively for tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hightlight was La Nuit Blanche; which is a night festival, where I
walked around and saw art, watched films in the Hotel de Ville and saw
fireworks on the Seine. I got these awesome photos at the beginning of
the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dog was just walking around on his own through the crowd he looked
like he was having so much fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10280288496/" title="P1000599 by Alistair Magee, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000599" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2830/10280288496_a017741626_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a random shot from the hip. I don't know these people are but
love how great this photo turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10280416483/" title="We're always this cool"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000592" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7350/10280416483_e032261d33_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This building looked great all greened up for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10280411853/" title="P1000608 by Alistair Magee, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000608" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7408/10280411853_034dcef54c_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall Paris, and France was enjoyable will definitely go back. I wish
I was better at french so I could've interacted with the locals more. A
common part of my travels so far, which has continued in New York, is
hanging out with a lot of Australians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second last day I had in Paris had a fun little coincidence. I'd put
off climbing the Eiffel tower and had finally got round to it. At the
bottom of the stairs though, I ran into Sammy and Lisa again, along with
a friend of Lisa. Lisa is on exchange at a business school near
Versailles, and Sammy was staying with her for the rest of her stay
(she'd been in Paris before their weekdend in Barcelona) so it was a
nice little surprise to run into them and have some company for the
climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10280355693/" title="P1000658 by Alistair Magee, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000658" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7410/10280355693_e89d7ac25e_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I suppose I'll have to learn to start posting photos of myself. So
here's me at the top of the Eiffel Tower. It was very cloudy and windy
and little bit rainy that day. Which was great because there was no
crowd, and the clouds cleared when we got to the top for a great view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I landed safely in France, hopped a very fast train to Avignon, and was
picked up in a car by a lovely lady named Diana and driven 2 hours to a
place called Le Mazel. Which is both the name of a small hamlet and the
name of the house (that we called the chateau even though that's not
technically accurate) that I was staying in. An improv buddy of mine,
Cindy, was celebrating her birthday in style with a long holiday in
France with friends from Australia and the rest of the world. When I
told her of my travel plans she insisted I join her for some of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was our view from the top of the tower on the chateau. There was a
forest fire two valleys over on the second day that I was there. Five
aeroplanes water-bombed it all afternoon and it was out by nightfall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004216725/" title="obviously this wasn't the only view, it was a tower, there was lots to see"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130919_163751" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2861/10004216725_4d4aee094b_z.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a different view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004215694/" title="Somedays, there was no fire at all"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130917_172046" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7292/10004215694_3b9d2d2b76_z.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly I laid around and rested. Went for a few walks, saw some old coal
mining sites and a roman viaduct that spanned the bottom of a valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004225975/" title="Look, roman thing. That means it's really old"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130918_125211" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7359/10004225975_ebb7e67d4d_z.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a grasshopper that turned up at dinner one night. He ate some
of my balsamic vinegar, and enjoyed it so much he hung around until
dinner the next night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004335523/" title="He was very friendly"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130918_203233" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7298/10004335523_3358178fe4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other guests found this awesome pink an white rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004214805/" title="2 coloured rose. Must be a mutant. I hope it's one of those nice X-men mutants."&gt;&lt;img alt="20130920_102809" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3817/10004214805_dd5865ce6a_z.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days the Chateau portion of the trip was over. I kept
travelling Cindy and Diana to Lyon, while everyone else went their own
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I did was use the awesome VeloV system, which is
hired bicycles (A system that actually works because there are no helmet
laws or a helmet law exemption or something). I used the bikes almost
everyday. One of the more fun things was riding along the river and
discovering a huge park that had a botanical gardens in it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004182864/" title="I don't know why I liked this bulbous thing so much"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130922_164540" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7357/10004182864_230ecb2dae.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004191475/"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130922_165657" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2867/10004191475_756b46e0d4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a small zoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004178234/" title="surprise zoo"&gt;&lt;img alt="20130922_170339" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5323/10004178234_fa4afbc7e6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guy was one of two spectacled bears in the zoo. I stumpbled across
the zoo by accident and these guys were the first thing I saw. It was
unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a whole bunch more stuff in Lyon. But I didn't take many photos,
because I didn't have a camera and while the camera in my phone is okay
for a phone camera, it isn't the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on the last day in Lyon I bought a new camera!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004240815/" title="The very first photo taken. Of course it's a selfie."&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000001" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7386/10004240815_151ca627e6_z.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the panasonic GX7 and a 20mm prime lens for it. I've wanted it for
about 2 months, when I first read about it, but it's brand new and only
became available this week. All the reviews indicated that it met my
needs of small camera (in comparison to a dslr, its still larger than a
point and shoot) and good photo quality, as well as decent video
capabilities. And I have to say it's really lived up to expectations,
and taken some great photos over the last few days, some of which I'll
post to here in the next few days. I'm not going to post everything on
the blog, but a lot is available at my flikr for those who are curious.
I'll eventually get a zoom lens but I'm limited to the prime for now,
which will be a fun challenge hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's one of Cindy (normally a huge grin on her face, i caught her at a
ponderous moment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004092636/" title="P1000030 by Alistair Magee, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1000030" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7337/10004092636_6cb243bf29_c.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very excited by the camera and plan to post to this blog a photo I
think is particularly interesting, quirky or fun everyday. So here is
your first interesting photo, some small books Cindy made in Lyon using
pamphlets and paper she had gathered in her tourist adventures. Stay
tuned for Paris, which is where I am now!&lt;/p&gt;

Needless
to say that a lot of stuff happened. I wanted to write a long post about
everything. But it's the kind of thing that I wouldn't want to post
unless it was perfect, and that would just lead to putting it off
forever. Basically a year ago I was having a lot of problems and I
needed to make some changes. I didn't work for about 4 months and things
weren't great. Here is an abridged version of some of the things that
changed following this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Drawing of bridge with the word stuff under it" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bridge.png" title="bridge" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave up drinking. It's not the first time I've said that, but it's the
first time I haven't added the addendum of "for now".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered barefoot jogging. I went on a trip with some friends where
I started joggin along the beach and was really enjoying it. When I got
home I didn't really enjoy it as much. A google search put me on to the
barefoot running movement and I was inspired to try it. And jogging
became fun again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Drawing of man running barefoot" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Barefoot-Run.png" title="Barefoot Run" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More days lost to the internet after this showed me tiny houses and
minimalist living. Again I was inspired and I started downsizing my
life. When my housemates and I moved, I got a much smaller room and
filled it with less stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to start working again. For the last few years I've done art
department for TV shows. The 4 months off involved no TV work and I was
just picking up odd jobs, working for my dad and elsewhere. I was burnt
out. Returning to art department work showed me I really had lost
interest in the work: long hours without a schedule that I could plan
around. It is a job that consumes all your time, and I wasn't willing to
do that anymore for shows that I didn't enjoy or think were worth it. So
after finishing one show I started looking for something else to do, and
only sticking to casual gigs in the TV world so that I wouldn't get
stuck on something and lose all my time again. I contemplated other
jobs; there was a day that I considered becoming a baker at baker's
delight, I tried riding a pedicab around Sydney for a few weeks. I
contemplated other options, like returning to uni and finishing my
degree or applying for acting schools. But nothing seemed like the right
thing to do. I did do some enjoyable stuff during this time like some
improv teaching at a drama school and few days as an extra on a show I'd
previously done art department for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the minimalist blogs out there that I've read state that one of
the best things about having little stuff and few expenses are all the
money left over to dedicate to travel. I've had the urge to travel since
I was 16 when I spent two weeks in Japan. But due to my being generally
a lazy person, my overseas travel since then has consisted of week in
Thailand for a cousin's wedding and a week in the UK tagging along on my
father's business trip when he flew me over using his frequent flyer
points as a gift for my birthday. Well it was time to stop saying I
wanted to go travelling and start travelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 2m by 2.2m room became a single carry on sized bag and a mandolin I
don't know how to play that I got from a friend. I sold my van and I
filed my tax return. I decided I was going. I didn't know where, but it
was time go. I decided on a plan that had been boiling in the back of my
brain for a while, the 2 year working holiday visa for young Australians
to live and work in the UK. Other than that I had no plan. All I wanted
was to leave soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days struggle I ended up taking one last job for 8 weeks. It
was difficult because I now knew what I wanted, but the extra money
allowed me to buy a new computer, a surface pro, to replace my heavy
macbook and tablet for travel and have a bit more or a safety margin for
the initial holiday part of my trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Crude drawing of a surface pro computer" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/surface.png" title="surface" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm ~~writing this now on the aeroplane en route to the final week of
filming~~ finished writing this up after filming (this job really does
eat up all your time). Posting from Kuala Lumpur airport waiting for my
connecting flight to France where I'll spend three weeks hanging out
with friends, exploring and catching up on sleep. I've been learning
french using Duolingo. After that I have 2 months in the US, basing
myself with a friend who has an apartment in New York, but travelling
around different places so I don't become a burden on him. I'll try to
do some improv courses and catch some comedy and theater. And then in
December I land in the UK to start something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no plans or jobs lined up. I have my savings and a work visa. For
the next few years I'm a professional nomad, going where opportunity
calls and interesting things seem to be happening. I'll most likely be
alternating between short term work in the UK and travelling different
parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's why it's important to give up on the posts about the dark
stuff that I've been putting off writing, and start posting again.
Because life is now an adventure, and my friends have begged me to keep
them up to date.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Adventure"></category><category term="Alcohol"></category><category term="Art"></category><category term="Barefoot"></category><category term="Drawing"></category><category term="Drinking"></category><category term="Jogging"></category><category term="Mental Issues"></category><category term="Minimalism"></category><category term="Running"></category><category term="Travel"></category><category term="Work"></category></entry><entry><title>Removing rather than Adding</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2012/December/removing-rather-than-adding/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-12-11T12:48:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-12-11:2012/December/removing-rather-than-adding/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After such a long time without a post it might be a bit strange that I

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Drawing of Hot Air Balloon through sniper's scope" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Deadliest-Game.jpg" title="Deadliest Game" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was inspired by an episode of an awesome podcast, Historians of Time,
done by some friends of mine in a comedy group called the Invention of
Dragons. Check them out at &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/InventionOfDragons%20" title="IODragons "&gt;http://www.facebook.com/InventionOfDragons&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also the other day I drew this for another awesome group of funny
friends, the Project 52. They do comedy at one of the Hermann's bar at
Sydney Uni every Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cartoon of Giant Duck fighting a Giant Bear" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Cover-Photo.jpg" title="Cover Photo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wanted a cover photo for their facebook page that was a little more
specific to themeselves, so I made this as an option for them. Their
four regular shows are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make way for ducklings; a sketch show.&lt;br /&gt;
The Improv Den; which features a performance by the Bear Pack in the
second half.&lt;br /&gt;
Story Club; which is stories written by people and performed by them,
by reading from a book from chair.&lt;br /&gt;
Comedy Tonic; a stand up night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tried to incorporate that into a picture and they had a previous
poster witha robot fighting a dinosaur that I drew inspiration from. I
don't know if they'll use it, but it was fun to make. Check them out at

Jokes are
difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I found something. It's a feeling guys. That transcendent moment
when the thought I just had distills into setup and punchline. The
feeling of future laughs, echoing through time. I had one joke tonight
that got that feeling when I wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's another feeling. The "I find this joke funny feeling but it will
probably only get a mild chuckles" feeling. That's fine, that's a fun
place as well. Because I can sell it. Or save it. I had a joke like that
tonight, which I save with a second punchline. It gave me smiles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then theres the ideas that have something amusing about them. But they
are not jokes. They don't have feelings attached to them. What does
Billy the Cat have to say about those ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope, not today. (Billy lives at my brother's house. He is very wise
regarding the art of making laughs.)&lt;/p&gt;

updating, I really did, but I was in bed sick all week with a bad fever.
I'm still having trouble concentrating. This leads to the double problem

think through. (I don't like this vague sentence any more but I dislike
removing it more. Needless to say my brain is hurting.)&lt;/p&gt;

enough, and it definitely can't be finished today. I'll try again
tomorrow. I hope to finish it, but there is a &gt; 0% chance I hate it

Plus
a regular 10 hour day. I just really didn't have the time to myself in
order to comic or blog. I was creative at one point of the week, but it
was something I wasn't sure I could post, but it turns out I can so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started working my friend Paul's computer game start up, See
Through Studios. It's a bit of fun, I hope to be helpful there. So the
one day I stayed up late I was creating this...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Overhead view of triangles with lights" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/lighting-scaled.jpg" title="lighting scaled" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a small concept for a possible style for the game they're working
on at the moment, set in the world of
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland"&gt;Flatland.&lt;/a&gt; It's unlikely that
this will be used, but it was a important for me to do, because I'd had
the idea stuck in my head and I also learnt to use a little bit of
Blender, a 3d modelling and animation software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other work news, besides working heavily this last week, I've got a
interview for a runner's role on a small show on Wednesday. I don't know
if I want to take it, I'm enjoying the freedom of the casual work load,
but steady income is nice. But I'm not feeling it, that is I'm not
excited about the job. Maybe I'll warm up to it, but it's a commitment
to not the things I want to be working on for 8 weeks. Stuff like the
musical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In musical news, no further contact has come through. Which means my
zero effort at finding a venue has probably resulted in not having a
venue. This is probably a good thing, I've been feeling a little uneasy
about the schedule. I'm a huge fan of pumping out content and seeing
what sticks to the wall, but everything has it's place and I feel my
first musical should be given the time it needs to mature into the show
I want it to be rather than forced onto an artificially accelerated
timeline due to a whim. This will not be going on the back burner (not
that I've been as focused as I should be on it) but unless I get the
phone call in the next two days (and maybe even then) the whole thing is
getting pushed back to November/December. Also I still kind of like the
idea of filming it rather than making it a stage show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this has been a stream of consciousness that I don't plan on
re-reading or editing. Hopefully I've been slightly coherent and it all
makes sense.

they are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

is that I'm much more likely to give someone the benefit of the doubt if

I've been having are because of this stance. But while I love playing
devil's advocate for a range of things, there are a few things I
genuinely believe in, that I defend the opposing view point of. Which
makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;

uncomfortable switching the other way, to berate and belittle the things

basically said you can save money buying non-canon lenses second hand
and buying adaptors to fit them to my camera. Stage one went fantastic,
I bought a great looking Olympus 50mm prime lens from ebay and it
shipped in a day. Stage 2 order an adaptor ring also from ebay. This
stage failed so spectacularly. I've owned the camera for a month, and I
really wanted to start by using my own lenses so I could get a feel for
them. Today I used it for the first time (it's gorgeous btw, very happy
with it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ebay ring still hasn't shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up going into a brick and mortar camera store and buying a very
expensive adaptor ring so I could finally start playing with my camera,
negating most of the advantage of buying off brand. Never the less, it
looks great and I have some very video friendly friends. I'll import the
videos and try to edit something together later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if I could only think of a project to film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I forgot how draining working a full week could be. Back
at Masterchef for the week, and working in that studio is very draining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other other news, I have my 3rd (actually 4th) ever stand up gig on
Monday, which I'm really looking forward too. I'll try and record it
with my new camera and sound recorder. I've been thinking a lot about
comedy lately. I don't think this will help me be funny, but it's a
point of conversation that could be raise and discussed if this wasn't
such a one way mode of conversation. With you, my non-existent
readership.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Ebay"></category><category term="Equipment"></category><category term="Impatience"></category><category term="Masterchef"></category><category term="Photography"></category><category term="Shipping"></category><category term="Standup"></category><category term="Update"></category><category term="Work"></category></entry><entry><title>On one particular podcast</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2012/May/on-one-particular-podcast/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-03T02:21:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-05-03:2012/May/on-one-particular-podcast/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the "This American Life" podcast today; the Ten
Commandments episode. There was a lot of stuff in there that I want to
think on, and there's already at least one comic idea stewing in my head
(not today though, 13 hour work day is long). There is a moment in one
of the stories that particularly strikes me at the moment. A virgin is
counselled by his christian minister to attend a sexaholics meeting to
help with his "impure thoughts"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its almost funny, if it wasn't so horrifically sad. And to make it
worse, at no point does the story teller even seem to consider that it's
horrible. Before he tells us how he eventually found relief when he
encountered a christian counseller kind enough to say, "hey, just jerk
it," (paraphrased) he describes how none of the (legitimate) sexaholics
understand his situation. With a tone, that smacks to me of sadness at
his believed illness rather than the quite awful situation he should
never have been put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a an athiest, I don't often seek out the witness and faith of
believers. I forget that the majority of Americans are religious, and a
show like This American Life doing a Ten Commandments episode will do it
earnestly and won't be a deconstruction of the commandments and
religion. And in accidentally stumbling across something I wouldn't seek
out I'm given a chance to question and re-affirm my beliefs. And how did
I feel after the episode? Sad. Sad that good, decent people (there were
a few stories with a similar resonance to me) are forced to engage in a
mental self torture for their faith. Sad that good people need to make
them selves miserable to make themselves feel like they are good people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't find god listening to this, but I learnt how cruel religion can
be, especially to the truest believer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="America"></category><category term="Atheism"></category><category term="Athiest"></category><category term="Mental Heath"></category><category term="Musings"></category><category term="Philosophy"></category><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="Religion"></category><category term="This American Life"></category></entry><entry><title>On writing and other things I tell myself I like</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2012/April/on-writing-and-other-things-i-tell-myself-i-like/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-04-28T02:19:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-04-28:2012/April/on-writing-and-other-things-i-tell-myself-i-like/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Calling myself a writer makes it true right? I'm a comedian because I
say so. Sometimes I stand on stage, that makes me a performer. I own an
electric piano, I'm a fucking musician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't actually do those things. I tell myself I enjoy them, that they
are important to my self identity. But I don't live in the real world. I
live in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world I can work hard. I do work hard. I have had it
reinforced many times that (despite even my sometimes incessant need to
be late) I'm good at my job and a pleasure to work with. I could clock
on everyday, do what needs to be done, work a long day, go home and
switch off and repeat everyday for a long time. And there is nothing
inherently wrong with that. Except for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying that I've never worked hard for something, that I've
never actively pursued things. But it's not my standard operating
procedure. I turn up, and try to do the absolute best that I can while
I'm there. But that turning up is necessary. I don't work on my own. I
don't further or better myself. I'm not who I want to be. I can sit and
think about the things I want to do. I'm very good at imagining myself
living. I rarely do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performer. Writer. Comedian. Artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are these things important to me? Or why do I think they are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does anyone do the things they do? I'm not just a consumer, I'm a
devourer. I obsess over television to the point of not even enjoying the
act of watching it anymore. I thrive on dissection. On long
conversations about minutia, the what if's and the what does it mean for
us? And then I try to work out how it could've been done better. But
this is all a passive act, not an active one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like to admit this often, but I have a huge ego. But it's the
procrastinators ego. I never do anything, because if I don't try I can't
be proven wrong. In my head I can be perfect. In the real world I'm
lazy. I'm passionless. I'm wasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you meet someone for the first time you ask what they do, not what
they think they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't deserve my ego. But I can't live at the other end of the
spectrum either. When I'm there, it's worse than being lazy. I can't
give up on myself. I'm worth it. I have done things I'm genuinely proud
of. Things that I look back on that I struggle to give myself credit for
because it can't be because of me; I'm a lazy, useless individual. But I
did do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are the labels important for me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it's who I want to be. It's the next step. It's not stopping
before I even get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how do I achieve them. How can I answer the "what do you do"
question the way I want to? By knowing and accepting myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008 I co-directed and was in charge of the writing of the 2008
science revue. Something I had no experience in. That's one of those
things I remember a different me doing, because something worked. It
worked very well and some very good stuff came from it. And what can I
learn from the more successful and happy me. Churn out content, and have
deadlines. Most of it won't be good and will later have to be thrown
away. But you can't edit a blank page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is building up a really long way of saying that this, my own
personal spot on the internet will no longer be a blank page. I plan on
posting something everyday. It won't always be big, it won't always be
good, but it will be something. Because the only way I can learn to be
who I want to be is to be who I want to be, and not someone just
thinking about it. And I know that everyday is an impossible schedule,
and I will miss days. But I'm not giving myself the out of "a few days a
week". I know myself. I'm all or nothing and I'm sick of being nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Directing"></category><category term="Ego"></category><category term="Frustration"></category><category term="Performing"></category><category term="Ranting"></category><category term="Science Revue"></category><category term="Self Doubt"></category><category term="Success"></category><category term="Writing"></category></entry><entry><title>Media Page</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2011/December/media-page/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-09T12:45:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2011-12-09:2011/December/media-page/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href="media"&gt;media link&lt;/a&gt; in the side bar.

by the way, congrats to all the players) I was talking to a friend of
mine about my job, which is Art Department runner on a TV show. And she
asked if it was the set-up for my future career. I immediately said no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I've been asked in the past I always add these caveats and
conditions to that answer (which I did add later), like how it's in the
right industry, I actually do enjoy the work and if I ended up being art
department for the next 20 years I feel I would have a great career.
However this time, in the heat of conversation, it was a snap no, this
is not what I want to be doing for my life. Part of that is probably a
little bit of frustration at this particular jobs annoyances, but mostly
it's because I'm finally willing to admit my passions to myself. I want
to be a performer/writer/director whatever. I want to be a creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a struggle to juggle ego with self doubt, but it's time to realise
what my strengths and weaknesses are. And it's time to start embracing
those strengths rather than wallowing in the weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Cranston Cup"></category><category term="Frustrations"></category><category term="Passions"></category><category term="Personal Growth"></category><category term="Work"></category></entry><entry><title>Work Logo</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/2011/October/work-logo/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-10-23T22:28:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2011-10-23:2011/October/work-logo/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the new job our department is going to have two teams.

Hey you, sorry we haven't talked in so long, we should definitely catch
up soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enjoy the ride, ridicule me harshly. Updates will be sporadic

something I don't.&lt;/p&gt;
