&lt;p&gt;I don't know if the joke is funny but i'm really happy with how it
turned out visually. If I'd angled the axe head the right way the first
panel is almost exactly how I was imagining it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Angler Beast</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/one-shot-comics/angler-beast/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-22T02:28:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-05-22:one-shot-comics/angler-beast/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I really hope this works how I hope it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanted to ad text but I thought it worked well without it. Imagine
something along the lines of distant cousin to the angler fish, i
discovered this one night, it wasn't dark and stormy but it was soon
just as scary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or something.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The Future</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/one-shot-comics/the-future/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-16T02:54:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-05-16:one-shot-comics/the-future/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think I might also turn this into a standup bit if I can tell it

It's supposed to be about
economical writing, getting to the point and not letting logic and all
my complex thoughts and points of view get in too much of the way of the
funny. It's not that I shouldn't be trying to make a point (I'm a big
believer in, and fan of, the power that comedy has to inform and change
opinions), but sometimes trying to say too much can be just as bad as
saying nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically I think I missed too much set up for this rather random joke,
undercutting it's message.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Red Bull</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/one-shot-comics/red-bull/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-02T00:45:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-05-02:one-shot-comics/red-bull/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yeah it's pretty amazing stuff&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Applause</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/one-shot-comics/applause/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-04-30T00:19:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-04-30:one-shot-comics/applause/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I couldn't un-think this once I realised it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Swimming Upstream</title><link href="http://realityimprovement.com/one-shot-comics/swimming-upstream/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-01-29T00:58:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Alistair</name></author><id>tag:realityimprovement.com,2012-01-29:one-shot-comics/swimming-upstream/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This comic is based on fact.
