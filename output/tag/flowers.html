                <p>Bonjour!</p>
<p>I landed safely in France, hopped a very fast train to Avignon, and was
picked up in a car by a lovely lady named Diana and driven 2 hours to a
place called Le Mazel. Which is both the name of a small hamlet and the
name of the house (that we called the chateau even though that's not
technically accurate) that I was staying in. An improv buddy of mine,
Cindy, was celebrating her birthday in style with a long holiday in
France with friends from Australia and the rest of the world. When I
told her of my travel plans she insisted I join her for some of it.</p>
<p>This was our view from the top of the tower on the chateau. There was a
forest fire two valleys over on the second day that I was there. Five
aeroplanes water-bombed it all afternoon and it was out by nightfall.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004216725/" title="obviously this wasn't the only view, it was a tower, there was lots to see"><img alt="20130919_163751" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2861/10004216725_4d4aee094b_z.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Here's a different view.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004215694/" title="Somedays, there was no fire at all"><img alt="20130917_172046" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7292/10004215694_3b9d2d2b76_z.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Mostly I laid around and rested. Went for a few walks, saw some old coal
mining sites and a roman viaduct that spanned the bottom of a valley.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004225975/" title="Look, roman thing. That means it's really old"><img alt="20130918_125211" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7359/10004225975_ebb7e67d4d_z.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This was a grasshopper that turned up at dinner one night. He ate some
of my balsamic vinegar, and enjoyed it so much he hung around until
dinner the next night.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004335523/" title="He was very friendly"><img alt="20130918_203233" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7298/10004335523_3358178fe4.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>One of the other guests found this awesome pink an white rose.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004214805/" title="2 coloured rose. Must be a mutant. I hope it's one of those nice X-men mutants."><img alt="20130920_102809" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3817/10004214805_dd5865ce6a_z.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>After a few days the Chateau portion of the trip was over. I kept
travelling Cindy and Diana to Lyon, while everyone else went their own
way.</p>
<p>One of the first things I did was use the awesome VeloV system, which is
hired bicycles (A system that actually works because there are no helmet
laws or a helmet law exemption or something). I used the bikes almost
everyday. One of the more fun things was riding along the river and
discovering a huge park that had a botanical gardens in it...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004182864/" title="I don't know why I liked this bulbous thing so much"><img alt="20130922_164540" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7357/10004182864_230ecb2dae.jpg" /></a>  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004191475/"><img alt="20130922_165657" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2867/10004191475_756b46e0d4.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>And a small zoo!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004178234/" title="surprise zoo"><img alt="20130922_170339" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5323/10004178234_fa4afbc7e6.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This guy was one of two spectacled bears in the zoo. I stumpbled across
the zoo by accident and these guys were the first thing I saw. It was
unexpected.</p>
<p>I did a whole bunch more stuff in Lyon. But I didn't take many photos,
because I didn't have a camera and while the camera in my phone is okay
for a phone camera, it isn't the same.</p>
<p>So on the last day in Lyon I bought a new camera!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004240815/" title="The very first photo taken. Of course it's a selfie."><img alt="P1000001" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7386/10004240815_151ca627e6_z.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>It's the panasonic GX7 and a 20mm prime lens for it. I've wanted it for
about 2 months, when I first read about it, but it's brand new and only
became available this week. All the reviews indicated that it met my
needs of small camera (in comparison to a dslr, its still larger than a
point and shoot) and good photo quality, as well as decent video
capabilities. And I have to say it's really lived up to expectations,
and taken some great photos over the last few days, some of which I'll
post to here in the next few days. I'm not going to post everything on
the blog, but a lot is available at my flikr for those who are curious.
I'll eventually get a zoom lens but I'm limited to the prime for now,
which will be a fun challenge hopefully.</p>
<p>Here's one of Cindy (normally a huge grin on her face, i caught her at a
ponderous moment)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97350976@N07/10004092636/" title="P1000030 by Alistair Magee, on Flickr"><img alt="P1000030" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7337/10004092636_6cb243bf29_c.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I'm very excited by the camera and plan to post to this blog a photo I
think is particularly interesting, quirky or fun everyday. So here is
your first interesting photo, some small books Cindy made in Lyon using
pamphlets and paper she had gathered in her tourist adventures. Stay
tuned for Paris, which is where I am now!</p>
