</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I worked very hard this week, a 13 hour, 14 hour and a 15 hour day. Plus
a regular 10 hour day. I just really didn't have the time to myself in
order to comic or blog. I was creative at one point of the week, but it
was something I wasn't sure I could post, but it turns out I can so:</p>
<p>I've started working my friend Paul's computer game start up, See
Through Studios. It's a bit of fun, I hope to be helpful there. So the
one day I stayed up late I was creating this...</p>
<p><img alt="Overhead view of triangles with lights" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/lighting-scaled.jpg" title="lighting scaled" /></p>
<p>It's a small concept for a possible style for the game they're working
on at the moment, set in the world of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland">Flatland.</a> It's unlikely that
this will be used, but it was a important for me to do, because I'd had
the idea stuck in my head and I also learnt to use a little bit of
Blender, a 3d modelling and animation software.</p>
<p>In other work news, besides working heavily this last week, I've got a
interview for a runner's role on a small show on Wednesday. I don't know
if I want to take it, I'm enjoying the freedom of the casual work load,
but steady income is nice. But I'm not feeling it, that is I'm not
excited about the job. Maybe I'll warm up to it, but it's a commitment
to not the things I want to be working on for 8 weeks. Stuff like the
musical.</p>
<p>In musical news, no further contact has come through. Which means my
zero effort at finding a venue has probably resulted in not having a
venue. This is probably a good thing, I've been feeling a little uneasy
about the schedule. I'm a huge fan of pumping out content and seeing
what sticks to the wall, but everything has it's place and I feel my
first musical should be given the time it needs to mature into the show
I want it to be rather than forced onto an artificially accelerated
timeline due to a whim. This will not be going on the back burner (not
that I've been as focused as I should be on it) but unless I get the
phone call in the next two days (and maybe even then) the whole thing is
getting pushed back to November/December. Also I still kind of like the
idea of filming it rather than making it a stage show.</p>
<p>So this has been a stream of consciousness that I don't plan on
re-reading or editing. Hopefully I've been slightly coherent and it all
makes sense. Regular updates to recommence.</p><section class="article-neighbors">
