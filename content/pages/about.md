### Me:

Hi, my name is Alistair. I'm often far too busy, I don't finish what I
start, I don't start what I should and I obsess over the unnecessary.
Like about pages.

I often feel unproductive and am striving to change this. This website
is one of those efforts.

### The Site:

It's a landing zone of the stuff I one day may call the projects in my
life. Ostensibly it's a webcomic and blog, but hopefully I will be
adding more varied content down the line. Don't hold me to this (see
above).

The comic is created using [the GIMP Image editing
program](http://www.gimp.org/) and a Wacom Tablet.
