Slug: removing-rather-than-adding

After such a long time without a post it might be a bit strange that I
removed two of the videos in the media section. Not that anyone would
notice anyway. But I recently heard some good advice for aspiring
comedians on a podcast I subscribe to that advise to hold off uploading
gigs before you were ready. So I removed the two recordings I had up and
will keep them for my own use for now.

I have added something to the site though. [Click here to have a look at
