So turns out working a 16 hour day leaves you very tired. Who'd of thunk
it.

Also worth realising, was my realisation today. It doesn't matter how
nice, earnest and easy to get along with a person is; if they are wrong,
they are wrong.

This seems slightly at odds with some of my knowledge about myself, that
is that I'm much more likely to give someone the benefit of the doubt if
the speak passionately and energetically. In fact some of the conflicts
I've been having are because of this stance. But while I love playing
devil's advocate for a range of things, there are a few things I
genuinely believe in, that I defend the opposing view point of. Which
makes no sense.

I don't know what to do with this new information. I would still feel
uncomfortable switching the other way, to berate and belittle the things
I don't like. I don't want to say I need to be angrier more often,
because I like that I'm mostly a chilled out person. But I would like to
know how to better take advantages of the insights I'm getting that a
lot of people don't get to have.
