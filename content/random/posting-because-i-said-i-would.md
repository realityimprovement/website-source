I really wanted to make a comic tonight, but despite having a few
working ideas swirling around in my head, I can't seem to get any down
on "paper". So blog post it is. But I don't really have anything to say.
I just went and saw Ross Noble for the second time, and he was great.
It's amazing to just start relating to a whole audience so quickly and
friendly like. I'm also inspired by his show format, the half written
half improvised stuff would be so fun to do I feel. Anyway, really good
night.

The thing from china finally shipped. Yay, useless now.

Happy Birthday Yas!

I've slept in too much the last couple of days, tomorrow I want to get
up and be useful, before I go to do some impro. Impro should be fun so
yay for that.

I'm in a weird mood.
