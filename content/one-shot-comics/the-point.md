I hope this makes some sort of sense. It's supposed to be about
economical writing, getting to the point and not letting logic and all
my complex thoughts and points of view get in too much of the way of the
funny. It's not that I shouldn't be trying to make a point (I'm a big
believer in, and fan of, the power that comedy has to inform and change
opinions), but sometimes trying to say too much can be just as bad as
saying nothing.

Ironically I think I missed too much set up for this rather random joke,
undercutting it's message.
