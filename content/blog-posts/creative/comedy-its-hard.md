I just got off stage doing some open mic stand up stuff. Jokes are
difficult.

But I found something. It's a feeling guys. That transcendent moment
when the thought I just had distills into setup and punchline. The
feeling of future laughs, echoing through time. I had one joke tonight
that got that feeling when I wrote it.

There's another feeling. The "I find this joke funny feeling but it will
probably only get a mild chuckles" feeling. That's fine, that's a fun
place as well. Because I can sell it. Or save it. I had a joke like that
tonight, which I save with a second punchline. It gave me smiles

Then theres the ideas that have something amusing about them. But they
are not jokes. They don't have feelings attached to them. What does
Billy the Cat have to say about those ideas?

Nope, not today. (Billy lives at my brother's house. He is very wise
regarding the art of making laughs.)

Finally references. They get the laugh I expect. Good old dependable
references.

Tomorrow, I'll post my headshots I made today. Because it's serious
business time in regards to getting the acting jobs. Also; narcissism.
