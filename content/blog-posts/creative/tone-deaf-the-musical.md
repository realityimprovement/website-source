Slug: tone-deaf-the-musical

That's the title I've just given the musical I haven't written yet. It
will be opening in September for the Sydney Fringe Festival assuming it
gets approved.

This is really happening. I'm super excited and super worried all at the
same time.

This is a good thing. No really it is.

I hope.
