Turns out I lied, but not for lack of good intentions. I wanted to be
updating, I really did, but I was in bed sick all week with a bad fever.
I'm still having trouble concentrating. This leads to the double problem
of not having written anything, nor done anything to inspire writing.

Anyway, lots of rage and stuff, in the most non rage-y way. Lots to
think through. (I don't like this vague sentence any more but I dislike
removing it more. Needless to say my brain is hurting.)

Was drawing a comic, but I feel it might be too ambitious and not funny
enough, and it definitely can't be finished today. I'll try again
tomorrow. I hope to finish it, but there is a \> 0% chance I hate it
halfway through and give up.

Standup on wednesday. Hooray.

This feels too short.
