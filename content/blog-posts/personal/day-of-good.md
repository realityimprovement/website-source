Today was spent doing awesome things. I had my first ever musical jam
with a friend of mine, we're starting a band or something. Anyways, it
was fun. Reminded me of all this musical theory stuff that I have stored
in the back of my brain somewhere.

Then went to the Vivid festival, which is like a festival of lights. Its
artistic installations that light up. Got some awesome photos and
hopefully some awesome video. Stand outs were the building used as a
digital canvas to tell a story, and I really enjoyed the three angler
fish mounted on tricycles that moved around Circular Quay.
