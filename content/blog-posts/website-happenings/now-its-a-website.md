So I have wasted enough time making the site presentable.

Spent the last couple of days just playing with the layout and CSS.
There's still a few niggly things that annoy me but I've definitely
reached the point where I can walk away from it and be happy. It's
simple and clean and that's good enough for now.

Now; make the things happen time.
