I'm going to try and wrap up my America trip quickly. I haven't done much since
I got to London, but I want to start writing about stuff a little closer to now
but still feel an urge to wrap up the previous trip. I think there will be two
on three entries about it. There is more to this story, there's a whole sub-plot
about a T-shirt I left behind in Missouri and realising I'd left my license in
Charlotte that really adds to the urgency. But I forgot about it until I'd 
finished my first draft, and I haven't yet learnt how to do second drafts.

Also one of my favourite places was Asheville, which I only remembered while 
looking for the photos for this post. But I visited there after Charlotte and
before Kansas. Actually a lot happened in between those two things but Kansas
is the one that I really felt like I had to write about for some reason. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Kansas is different, you'll see"

There were some phrases that were repeated again and again as I would cross
America. When I mentioned that my original plan was to hitch across the country
I would get a lot of "Oh no, you're crazy. You can't do that anymore."

I believe there is a lot revealed in the psyche of, if not Americans in general,
at least the ones I met. This mostly consisted of two types of people; People
sat around a casino poker table, as I'd gamble my way from state to state; and 
people I'd befriend at the town vegetarian restaurant that I'd find using the
useful [Happy Cow](www.happycow.net) phone app. To equally reveal something 
about my own degenerate nature I had many more encounters with the former rather
than the latter.

Oh, I did also meet Superman, 

![P1010346](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/14404026017_07466f6f76_c.jpg)

but he didn't have much to say.

What is revealed, I'm not entirely sure. There is definitly a lot of fear in the
air. I would often think unfounded fear, and then I'd remember how many guns 
were around.

Something else I heard everywhere I went, when I told people where I was going,
"Oh, they're not as nice as us here." This always turned out to be a lie. 
Everyone I met was lovely. I never met these phantom awful people everyone else
was afraid off. Again a statment that reveals something, not so much in what is 
said but in the sheer repetition. Here is good, there not so much. [^1]

So seeing the obvious falseness of this commonly held belief, I dismissed the 
warning I kept receiving as I moved further and further west. 

"Oh yeah, it's pretty here, but Kansas is different."

It doesn't help, that to my foreign brain the entirety of the middle America 
is lumped into one place. Coming across quaint places like this bowling alley 
that seemss traight out of some sort of all American TV show doesn't help this
opininon.

It just how it's supposed to be. So if it's pretty driving throuh one state, 
I'll enjoy driving through the next as much.

So I figured all this exaggeration about the madness inducing flatness of Kansas
was just that, an exaggeration. How wrong I was.

Each state has a feel, each rest stop has the same basic layout accross the 
country but yet there is a stil a unique feel to each state. But Kansas is the 
scariest.

Scariest is the wrong feeling. Foreboding.

Kansas is the most Foreboding.

At each rest stop in Kansas is a speaker crackling out the weather report.

Fine Weather Today.

Getting Colder as the week continues.

There may be snow by the end of the week.

Repeat forever.

I'm a little worried about snow later in the week, I'm not prepared for that
and I know I'm heading up the Colardo mountains. But the weather report says
it will be fine for a few days. So why does this whole situation just give me
the heebee jeebies.

Maybe it is the flatness. There is no corn. It's November so all the corn has
been harvested. So literally the only thing I can see is this weird juxtapositon
of fields of small oil pumps alongside fields of windmill genearators. And 
nothing.

Not nothing. Nothing I can deal with. I've breifly visited the north-west corner
of Australia. Once I was outside of town, you are literally nowhere. There is 
nothing for miles.

See Kansas is different. There's not nothing. There's something else. There are
two roads, the interstate heading east-west and the interstate heading 
north-south both meeting in the center of the state. 

Then along these roads  there are towns. Every 20 or 30 so miles, each with a 
water tower declaring their name. It's the isolation, without the nothingness.
It's a weird feeling. 

I stopped and bought a pizza from a Pizza Hut in one of these towns. I think 
that illustrates most clearly what I'm trying to say. You're just not really
in the middle of nowhere if you can stop and buy Pizza Hut. But then I
drove to park to have an a pizza picnic. And again despite being in what 
amounted to small town suburbia, there was that overwheling air of isolation. 

I pondered as I ate. I could just turn south. Now was the time to do it. I
was almost exactly halfway across the state. But I was halfway accross. I could
make it.

See I was still working on a deadline. Andy was going on holiday in 5 days. So
I had to get to San Francisco before then to see him. And I'd want to hang out 

Six Hours, 3 more rest stop nightmare factories and one gas station fill up 
later I crossed the Colarado border. The road was immediately different. There
was a physical line at the border where two different strains of ashphalt 
greeted each other

I pulled into a rest stopand really started to evaluate my situation
again. It was getting late, I'd have to stop for the night soon. People had
warned me there were a few more hours of flat after crossing the border before
the mountains started. More of the same if with a slightly different flavour. 
But then I looked at my map of America again. I had barely reached the halfway 
point of the country. If I was going to cross in 3 days I would have to drive 
without stopping. And then I would have to turn back straight away again to get
back to the East Coast. [^2] I wasn't going to make it to San Francisco. It was 
time to go back to plan A and head for New Orleans. 

In the end Kansas won. I must of gone a little mad. Because in my rush to get
across it as quickly as possible I'd fallen right into it's trap. Remember,
there are only two roads through Kansas, and they meet in the middle. If I 
wanted to go South, I was going to have to go East first. So after
what amounted to half an hour in Colarado, I turned around, and drove back into 
Kansas. 

[^1] In probably a related phenomenon, everyone was shocked that I'd left 
Australia. It was unfathomable that someone would leave somewhere they had heard
was so nice just because I wanted to see other things.

[^2] Flying back wasn't a great option. There was the one way cost of the hire
car but then there was also the fact that my driver's license was in Charlotte
(see intro to this post about why that isn't mentioned anywhere else)(Sometimes
there is draft 1.5, alright)
