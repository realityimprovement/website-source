A plane lands first thing in the morning, and a tube is caught accross town.
A hug from a friend, before 3 days asleep on a couch, sometimes the floor. 
The room is the loungeroom and residents of the house step around and over me to 
access the kitchen. I do not
notice. Neccesary chores happen in a daze, a bank account opened, a National
Insurance number applied for. A room in a sharehouse is found on Facebook. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My first home is a sharehouse in the west London suburb of Acton; the defacto
location of new Australians in town. I found it on the facebook group Kiwis 
in London, New Zealanders and Australians helping each other out. A cheap if
somewhat rundown 5 bedroom. I'm in the smallest room upstairs, a slightly damp
room mostly occupied by an uncomfortable double bed and temporarily vacated
by an Australian couple returning home for a summer Christmas. A decidedly 
smarter plan than my arrive in a dark and cold December London. A large, often
crashed in loungeroom and a deceptively small and pokey kitchen (the eight
burner stove and 
two separate sinks conspire to rob the space of useable benchspace)
complete the picture.

I don't really like sleeping in their bed, so I start
experimenting with different options. I try the floor for a while before I settle
on a hammock. It hangsbetween the door and a chin up bar bought off ebay, wedged
into the concrete window frame. I never quite got the right balance with my warmth
or comfort, but it was a fun time.

A whole bunch of easy excuses led to two months of not working. I could tell 
mysef  that I'd arrived too
late to get a December Christmas Job and I still didn't have my National Insurance
Number.[^1] But the biggest one was that I would be able to easily set myself
up for freelance work
building and designing websites. Something that I could do from road on my 
expected many journeys.

So I spent the months remembering how to program in Python, refreshing  my 
knowledge of HTML and CSS. But at the end of two months, a domain was bought but
no company was 
created, no new apps were built. My website had moved from Wordpress to Pelican
and I had officially contributed to an open source project. But the savings
were beginning to run low. I was Productive but note *Profitable*

There was no social life at this point. The amount of times I caught up with
friends over these two months can be counted on one hand. I was trying to live
cheaply in an expensive city. I didn't bond strongly with my new housemates. I 
was a shut in, jogging occaisonally and tapping away on my computer. The only 
new person I met was the owner of the new vegetarian restaurant around the 
corner, the food was very cheap. I did spend Christmas with Cecilia and James,
as they stopped by on their European holiday. And spent New Years with my friend
Chevy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The time at Acton is drawing to a close. The rooms real owners are returning.
I've started to venture from my cave. I've discovered the Barclay's Cycle Hire
and am riding it around town. I've discovered Improv. It exists in london. Not
only that I've made my first real London friends, all on my own. On one of my now
more frequent Journeys out of Zone 3 into the city I'm inspired by the cyclists
riding cargo cycles. I could do that.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accepting the realiy that the web stuff wasn't going to get picked up anytime
soon I started looking for an actual job. I was inspired by the cargo cycles 
some googling led me to email a company called Gnewt Cargo. And they wanted to
have a chat with me.

The website was a little out of date. They had traded up most of their tricycle
cargo rickshaws for electric vans. But they seemed like nice people and I needed
the job. And then fortune smiled brightly on me. The day of my training trial,
normally a two day affair, one of their drivers quit/was fired. And he was on
a TNT document route. A route currently being done on electric scooter, but 
one that would be suited to one of their Bullit Bikes. Pure pedal power. 
Training fast-forwarded due to need and the fact
that I wasn't an idiot and had done similar work in Australia and I was starting
work the next day.

A winter with no snow meant that February and March were actually the wettest
there have been in recent memory. To the North East of London, the country was
flooding. And I was out riding in it everyday and having a ball. Quickly learning
my patch of the city, the EC2 postcode, I was soon covering EC3 or EC4 on the
quiet days when drivers were sick or on holiday. I was finally *living* in 
London. My favourite moment was after a very wet moment. The sun peeked out 
behind a cloud, seeing if it was time for spring yet, just as I was riding past
the Tower of london. A gorgeous sight and uniquely London, I could not have had
this experience back in Sydney. There's no Tower of London there. 

Not all things can last though. As the months ended the document route added
parcels and collections. Not wanting to be in a van full time, I trained up 
a replacement and was moved to a Hermes route. Delivering
online shopping parcels, running back and fourth from the depot five or six times
a day to my new, much smaller delivery zone of the few blocks immediately 
surrounding the depot.

My Second home in London was my friend Chevy's apartment. A new development in
the stylish Central London Suburb of Shoreditch. She doesn't like it, she 
thinks it was cheaply constructed and is annoyed by the design decsicions, or
lack of them, that were made. But she had a spare bed in her lounge room; The 
place had come furnished but she had her own bed she liked so moved the owners
to the large loungeroom. But I think it's great.

I'm broke and wouldn't get paid for a long time [^2]. My first month was rent 
free. And as it's only a bed in a loungeroom it's cheap even when I do start
paying. Unfortunately I can be quite a bad houseguest. And this situation was
very much still like I was a guest in someone else's house. While rent 
was always paid, it was not always prompt. And with my tendency to treat home as
just somewhere to sleep and the tiring nature of the physical work I wasn't 
the best company even when I was home. I think Chevy was starting to think her 
hospitality was being taken advantage of.

However this is the time when my social life exploded in London. I found the improv 
scene. I started making friends. Hoopla, then C3467X and Duck Duck Goose. Shem
and Carleen became my first real London friends that I made all on my own. Then
Carleen put me together with Will, Corey and James and we formed
the soon to be named King Me troupe, although we played our first gig, the 
improv 5-a-side, as "Mumma's Boys" named by the proud Carleen. 

I was living with a good friend. I had a bunch of new improv friends. I was 
seeing Anne fairly regularly as she also worked in the city, and slowly being
introduced to her circle of London friends.
I even started to take advatange of the London bits of London; I saw the Book of
Mormon, Let the Right One in and Warhorse. Theatre is still expensive but some
is better than none. It was a good time. Mostly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growing frustrations start to bubble to the surface. Work is leading to an
escalating cycle of tiredness and frustration. London is an expensive city to
live in. Despite a full time job and the cheapest possible rent, I feel 
very poor. In two weeks a new contract means we're moving depots and I will
probably be back in a van full time. I'm training new drivers right now anyway 
so most days are in the van already. I didn't quit my job in Australia to 
travel halfway accross the globe to spend my days driving a van again.

An escape is needed. Vic and Nevine are in
France. "Come spend a few days in Dieppe with us and some French friends". So
after 5 months in London, my first adventure into Europe is back to France.
A train to Brighton. A ferry to Dieppe. And three days spent on beach made up
of smooth pebbles the size of tennis balls. It is glorious.

London is returned to with much trepidation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

London starts to collapse after this. My trip to Chicago to study improv for 5
weeks is less than 2 months away. My preliminary budget leaves me with exactly
no money on arrival in America.

While in Dieppe, Chevy told me
that she needs me out of the apartment so that Katie can move in in a few weeks.
I knew it was coming, but it was an awkward end, the earlier tensions making it
more stressful than it needed to be. I went straight to a hostel on returning
to London. I had an ambitious plan to work during the week then travel to 
somewhere new in England each weekend. I went to Nottingham and that's it before 
this plan ended.

My third home in London arrived as an offer from a work friend when he heard I 
was living in Hostels full time. It was a room in an apartment in Muswell Hill. 
One of London's "highest"
points (London is rather flat) and a nice suburb. But an hours bus ride from
work and central london. Way outside the Borris Bike zone. I hesitated before
moving in, but it was 30 pounds cheaper a week than a hostel, and my budget
needed the help.

Work lasts 3 more weeks before the combination of early starts and little sleep
due to the now much longer commute both ways and the frustration at 
full time van driving in a
small pocket of central london build up to the point of me quitting the job 3 
weeks earlier than planned. So much for the budget.

Meanwhile
I'm doing improv fairly regularly but I'm not entirely happy with the way I'm
playing. I'm frustrated  with myself, I'm not performing as much as I want and
I'm not travelling Europe. These were the two reasons I moved to the UK. I'm 
starting to get homesick. I miss my friends in Sydney but most of all I'm missing
my sister Lily, who is now seven years old and growing up fast.

I borrow a bicycle from a friend of a friend. The three times I ride it are 
wonderful. It really is a great way to get around town. It's stolen, despite 
being locked up, the third time I ride it. I sit where the bike was stolen, 
almost cry and vow that I'm done with this city. It's hard to remember the good
parts at this point; berry picking in two different parts of the English 
countryside, picnics with friends in the green English summer.

I catch the plane back to America, filled with excitement of what's to come,
frustration at the city I'm leaving and a significant lack of accomodation
booked for a trip I've been planning for months. 

[^1]: Ah British Beauracracy, my first real pang of homesickness. I will try 
never to complain about things taking a long time in Australia ever again.

[^2]: Everyone in London is paid monthly, something I've not had to deal with
before. Also I'm still having issues with my National Insurance Number, the 
number required for paying tax. After 3 and a half months. See footnote 1.
